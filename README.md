# AlgorithmAnalysis

A small Java application that uses some diffrent Algorithm:

1. (Main.java) counts equal pairs in an array.
2. (Main2.java) calculates the number of unique pairs possible from a set of size "m".
3. (Uppg1c.java) efficiently counts all pairs of equal values in an integer array by first counting occurrences, then summing the possible pairs for each value.
